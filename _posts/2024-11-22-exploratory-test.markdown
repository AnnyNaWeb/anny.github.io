Ensuring the quality of an indie game can be challenging, especially with small teams and limited resources. 
Session-Based Exploratory Testing is a practical solution that combines structure with flexibility to identify 
issues and enhance the player's experience. Exploratory testing is not about doing tests without planning. Anyone on the team can do it, 
but it is important to have clear objectives to optimize the time of those responsible for the activity. 
Here's a step-by-step guide to implementing this method in your studio:


#Step 1: Plan Your Session (Design)
Define the focus of the test session by answering these questions:

- What is the mission?
- Example: "Test the responsiveness of controls in level 1."
- What is the scope?
- Determine what will be explored, such as a specific functionality, a game area, or AI behavior.
- How much time will you dedicate?
- Set a timebox (30 to 90 minutes) to ensure productivity.


#Step 2: Execute the Test (Run)
Follow the established mission while remaining flexible to explore unexpected areas. During the execution:

- Avoid rigid checklists.
- Observe unusual behaviors, even those outside the planned scope.
- Test creatively, simulating the unpredictability of players.


#Step 3: Record Observations (Observe)
Document all findings from the session, including:

- Bugs: Record details about the problem, such as reproduction steps, frequency, and impact.
- Example: "The character passes through walls when using the dash ability in level 2."
- Inconsistencies: Note discrepancies in the interface, NPC behavior, or performance issues.
- Expected Behaviors: Identify areas of the game that work as intended, highlighting what was well-executed.


#Step 4: Analyze and Learn (Learn)
After the session, review the findings and determine the next steps:

- Prioritize Fixes: Categorize bugs based on impact and urgency.
- Plan Future Sessions: Use the results to adjust the focus of subsequent tests.
- Share with the Team: Communicate findings to ensure everyone has a clear view of the game's current state.


#Additional Tips for Implementation
- Clear Documentation: Use tools like spreadsheets, Notion, or Trello to organize sessions, missions, and findings.
- Continuous Iteration: Each test session should inform the next, creating a continuous improvement cycle.
- Fast Feedback: Implement a process to deliver findings to developers quickly, facilitating problem resolution.
- Diverse Testers: Involve other team members or even external players to gain different perspectives.


##Why Use Session-Based Exploratory Testing?
This method balances the creativity needed to explore a game with the organization required to produce actionable results. Itâ€™s ideal for indie studios, allowing you to identify and fix issues efficiently, even with smaller teams.
