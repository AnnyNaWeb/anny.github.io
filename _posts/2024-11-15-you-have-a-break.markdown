The other day a friend had the opportunity to take on a QA freelance job and asked me for tips. Depending on the size of the company, the quality culture is different. Startups usually have limited time and scope, and need to launch the game before the money runs out. They see QA as a "moment", and leave it for the end as a "polishing" or testing stage, or a store checklist. 


If the company has more than one game released, Quality Assurance will probably work on defect control and adapt processes to deal with technical debt. Perhaps check community support, approve new releases.


If it is a very large company, it needs to innovate. It invests in hackathons, buys startups and the role of QA will be that of research and prototyping. Experimenting with new technologies, such as optimizing processes, creating new products. Programming or management skills are stronger.

There are many challenges and I am here to share my experiences and talk about good practices. Do you have a break? Let's talk!
