I love working from home, but I have to admit that it requires discipline. I created a separate space at home and when I was happy with the setup, my chair broke.

During a checkpoint call, with the camera off (thank God), I slowly fell to the floor. I didn't understand what had happened until I was on the floor. I didn't believe it. I left the call and sent it to the work group.

After a lot of research, and having doubts between the Thunder X3 and the DT3 Nero and my criteria for choosing the chair:

- Does it have lumbar support?

- Can it support more than 140 kg?

- Is there a warranty?

- Steel structure?
  
- Costs less than R$2000


I discovered a promotion on Amazon... and yes for everything!  I fell in love. [This is the link to the new chair](https://amzn.to/4ewnTZs) It was a long day, but 'chair is coming'...
